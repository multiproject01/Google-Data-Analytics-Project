**This is my Project**

It consists of a hypothetical Scenario where i work for a travel agency company as a Junior Data Analyst.
It focuses more on Cleaning and Analyzing data and not so much on Visualizing it.

Main Task of the company is to increase sales of trip Packages for Islands around the Mediterranean.
	
Scenario : 

Manager of Marketing after a survey noted that Air Pollution was a factor that made their customers choose their destination and asked the Data Analytics team to Produce reports for Air Pollution around the islands of the Mediterranean ,
since those islands had the biggest income for the company in the previous years, so he can  include the findings on promotional material for the next years.

He wanted to see the levels and change in the pollution, focusing on the major air pollutants and Air Quality Index, for  the years 2018-2023 to have a better understanding of which islands to spend more for advertising fees.
